# tAO_cardboardgame
Composing the prototype of a unique card + board game hybrid. Full name to be revealed at a later stage. More details will follow.

* Project type: Creating a "cardboard" game (Pet Project).
* Project prio: Main Project (highest priority).

## Project goals:

#### * Phase 1: Creating the basic concepts and game mechanics.

* Phase 1.2: Collect plausible card types, super- and subtypes on paper. =DONE!
* Phase 1.3: Thinking about layout, size and dimension of board game material. =DONE!
* Phase 1.4: Find first draft of practical placement rules for cards + board material. =DONE!

#### * Phase 2: Designing the first pack of card prototypes.

* Phase 2.1: Decide on a tool to create prototypes. I will use the MSE (MagicSetEditor) for now (link in dev note 2025-08-23 at bottom of this Readme). =DONE!
* Phase 2.2: Create a first draft of the Start Territory cards for each color. =DONE!
* Phase 2.3: Create and add custom resource symbols. =DONE!
